Such informal  negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.

                BINDING ARBITRATION 
              </span>
              <p>
                If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute  (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by  binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THIS PROVISION, PUTS OFF YOUR RIGHT TO  SUE IN COURT. 

              </p>
              <p>
                Any dispute, arising out of or in relation to this Terms and Conditions, including any question  regarding its breach, existence, validity or termination or the legal relationships established  by this Terms and Conditions shall be resolved by arbitration under the Lagos State Chamber  of Commerce International Arbitration Center Arbitration rules, which Rules are deemed to  be incorporated by reference into this clause. It is agreed that:

                  <li style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                    There shall be a sole Arbitrator who must be a legal practitioner and Fellow of the Chartered  institute of Arbitrators.

                  <li>
                    The seat or legal place of arbitration shall be Lagos Nigeria. 

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The governing law of this arbitration shall be the substantive laws of the Federal Republic of  Nigeria.

                  <li>
                    The Language of the arbitration shall be English.  
                    Nothing stated in this Terms and Conditions shall preclude Parties from litigating in court to  compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or  enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. 
                    In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Site be  commenced more than Five

If this provision is found  to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling  within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute  shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction 
                    above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
